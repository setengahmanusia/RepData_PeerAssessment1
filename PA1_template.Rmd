## Introduction

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type of devices are part of the "quantified self" movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

## 1- Load the data (i.e. read.csv())
Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis

```{r}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
str(data)
```
```{r}
head(data)
```


```{r}
attach(data)
totalPerDay <- tapply(steps,list(date),sum)
detach(data)
```
## 2- What is mean total number of steps taken per day?


## Calculate the total number of steps taken per day.
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.
Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day.
For this part of the assignment the missing values can be ignored.
```{r}
hist(totalPerDay,breaks=25)
```

```{r}
meanPerDay = mean(totalPerDay,na.rm = TRUE)
meanPerDay
```

```{r}
medianPerDay <- median(totalPerDay,na.rm = TRUE)
medianPerDay
```

## 3- What is the average daily activity pattern?

Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```{r}
attach(data)
meanEvery5min <- tapply(steps,list(interval),mean,na.rm=TRUE)
detach(data)
```

```{r}
plot(meanEvery5min,type="l")
```


```{r}
which.max(meanEvery5min)
```

```{r}
meanEvery5min[104]
```

```{r}
max(meanEvery5min)
```

## 4-Imputing missing values

found the total number of missing values in the dataset
```{r}
calMissing <- sum(is.na(data$steps))
calMissing
```


```{r}
na <- is.na(data$steps)
shiftmeanEvery5min <- c(meanEvery5min[288],meanEvery5min[1:287])
imputedSteps <- rep(0,length(data$steps))
for (i in 1:length(data$steps))
{
  if(na[i])
    {
      imputedSteps[i] <- shiftmeanEvery5min[i%%length(meanEvery5min)+1]
    }
  else
    {
      imputedSteps[i] <- data$steps[i]
    } 
}
#data <- transform(data, data$imputedSteps = imputedSteps)
data <- cbind(data,imputedSteps)
str(data)
```

```{r}
head(data)
```

## Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
attach(data)
```


```{r}
totalPerDay2 <- tapply(imputedSteps,list(date),sum)
detach(data)
hist(totalPerDay2,breaks= 25)
```


```{r}
mean(totalPerDay2)
```

```{r}
median(totalPerDay2)
```

We found that the mean and median value in the  data  not differ very much from in the original data. same as the histogram does not differ too much with the histogram of the original data .

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```{r}
date <- levels(data$date)
daytype <- weekdays(as.Date(date))
for(i in 1:length(daytype))
  {
    if(daytype[i] %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"))
      {
        daytype[i] <- "weekday"
      }
    else
      {
        daytype[i] <- "weekend"
      }
  }
daytype <- as.factor(daytype)
isweekday <- rep(daytype,each=length(meanEvery5min))
data <- cbind(data,isweekday)
str(data)
```

```{r}
head(data)
```

```{r}
attach(data)
```


```{r}
daytypeDiff <- aggregate(imputedSteps, list(interval,isweekday), mean)
detach(data)
library(lattice)
```

```{r}
xyplot(x ~ Group.1|Group.2,data=daytypeDiff,type="l",layout=c(1,2),xlab="Interval",ylab="Number of Steps")
```
